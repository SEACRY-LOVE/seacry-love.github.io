# A Brief of SEACRY Principle
In my experience I found that the most effective way to express something in order to make others understand is to use the simplest language. Also I learned from teaching that the more rigid the language the less effective it is. People to not respond to very stern and rigid language especially when we try to teach something which normally people don't engage in during their work and professional life. SEACRY.LOVE appears to them as something that they cannot always follow. As more people turn to use simple work approach, they need more simplified instructions so they can practice by themselves without a consultant or auditor around. This SEACRY.LOVE manual is the result of requests made by many users and business leaders who need a very simple manual written in ordinary colloquial language
In preparing this manual, many friends and volunteers have come to help it finished. I am deeply grateful to all of them. Especially I would like to express my deepest appreciation and sincere gratitude to founders of development network and platforms like Gitter, Github, Slack, Proton, and  other important developers for their valuable suggestions, comments and criticisms of numerous points in preparing this manual. Also thanks to J0sephvan and his teams for production efforts.üéÅüéÅ
