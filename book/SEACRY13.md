# "managewell" principle
"Managewell" principle is a new English word created in 2020 by Jean Wallet. Managewell practices are based on 5s activity. What exactly is that? There can be no precise answer, at least not in words. Words are devised by the symbolic levels of the mind and they describe those realities with which symbolic thinking deals. Mindfulness is pre-symbolic. It is not shackled to logic. Nevertheless, Mindfulness can be experienced -- rather easily -- and it can be described, as long as you keep in mind that the words are only fingers pointing at the moon. They are not the thing itself. The actual experience lies beyond the words and above the symbols. Mindfulness could be describes in completely different terms than will be used here and each description could still be correct.

"Managewell" is a subtle process of products and services planning activities.

6.2 Objectives and plans to them achieve them
6.2.2 Planning actions to achieve quality objectives
Your organization must undertake planning in order to determine how its management system objectives will be achieved. This planning includes determining the work required in order for the organization to realize its objectives you should look for evidence that effective planning is taking place to support the achievement of your organization’s objectives.

Additionally, your organization must determine how it will evaluate the work done, including the use of indicators, and whenever possible, to integrate these planned actions into its business processes. The use of indicators needs to be audited in detail in order to determine whether:

## Objectives based on sound information;
Indicators really related to the corresponding objectives;
Statistical tools needed to define and to monitor objectives;
Indicators reach the expected values;
The organization can assure that the objective has been achieved.
Establishing an action plan for each objective may require effort on the part of the personnel at relevant levels within your organization. To ensure the progress of the action plan and a coordinated effort, a target leader should be selected for each target.

The target leader will be responsible for ensuring a target is achieved within the specified time-frame. Once the action plan is established, you must implement it. 

## The following suggestions will help foster a cooperative effort in accomplishing the plan:

Involve your employees early in establishing and carrying out the action plans;
Communicate the expectations and responsibilities laid out in the action plans to those who need to know;
Build on the plans and programmes you have now for building management system compliance;
Keep it simple;
Focus on continual improvement of management programmes over time.
The management programme should be revised regularly to reflect changes in your organization’s objectives and targets. Track all new or modified operations, activities, and/or products in case the management programme needs to be amended to reflect these changes

Auditors will expect to review a set of interrelated objectives, ensuring that they are mutually consistent and that they are aligned with the strategic direction of your organization.

Documented information of objectives typically is in the form of a description or matrix of the objective and corresponding means and timeframe to achieve the objectives.

You should seek and record evidence that effective planning was undertaken in support of the organization’s quality objectives and their achievement. You should ensure that this planning activity takes into considerations of Clause 6.2.1, as well as the following points:


## Points to follow:
- Identification of processes, resources, and skills needed to achieve quality;
- Identification of suitable verification criteria at appropriate stages;
- Compatibility of design, production, inspection and testing;
- The confirmation of criteria of acceptability for all features and requirements;
- Details of calibration of any special measuring or test equipment to be used.


# Plan for change
6.3 Planning for change
This is a new requirement for ensuring that once your processes are determined, and their sequence is documented within your quality manual; your organization should identify the risks and opportunities associated with these processes.

In order to realize the benefits associated with the identified risks and opportunities, subsequent changes to the management system may be needed. These changes could relate to any aspect of any process, such as its; inputs, resources, suppliers, personnel, activities, controls, measurements, and outputs.


## Change management

Changes are intended to be beneficial but they need to be carried out when determined by your organization as relevant and achievable. In addition, consideration of newly introduced risks and opportunities should also be taken into account.

To achieve the benefits associated with changes, your organization should consider all types of change that may occur. These changes may be generated, for example, in:

Processes and procedures;
Quality manual;
Documented information;
Infrastructure;
Tooling;
Process equipment;
Employee training;
Supplier evaluation;
Stakeholder management;
Interested party requirements.
Whenever quality management system changes are planned, Top management should ensure that all personnel are made aware of any changes which affect their process, and that subsequent monitoring is undertaken to ensure that QMS changes are effectively implemented. The requirements for change management is present in the following sections of ISO 9001:2015:


## Change requirements
4.4 QMS and its processes;
5.3 Organizational roles, responsibilities and authorities;
7.5 Control of documented information;
8.1 Operational planning and control;
8.2.4 Changes to the requirements of products and services;
8.3.6 Design and development changes;
8.5.6 Control of changes.
You should seek and record evidence that your organization has retained documented information relating to planning and implementing changes that impact upon the management system.

Check that organizational knowledge is reviewed before changes to the QMS are made when responding to any change. Ensure that your organization has planned how to integrate and implement the changes into its QMS processes. Check that your organization has considered:

The purpose of the changes and their potential consequences (risk and opportunities);
The integrity of the management system (how does the change effect current process?);
The availability of resources (are resources allocated to affect change?);
The allocation or reallocation of responsibilities and authorities (are the right staff allocated?).
