You can expect certain benefits from "leadwise" - "managewell" principle incorporated in product and service packages provided by SEACRY.LOVE. The initial ones are practical, prosaic things; the later stages are profoundly transcendent. They run together from the simple to the sublime. We will set forth some of them here. Your own experience is all that counts.

Those things that we called hindrances or defilements are more than just unpleasant mental habits. They are the primary manifestations of the ego process itself. The ego sense itself is essentially a feeling of separation -- a perception of distance between that which we call me, and that which we call other. This perception is held in place only if it is constantly exercised, and the hindrances constitute that exercise.

# SEACRY.LOVE Technology-as-a-Service (TaaS)

Enterprise resource management (ERM) is validated as a business excellence index. The strategy here Me and a global based business approach. It covers the enterprise resource planning (ERP) and the digital art of intellectual property asset management. We do not think this is a big word to say. It is real. It is happening around the world today. For example, if you are a local grocery providers to malls, then a certain criteria like hygiene, freshness, market price, etc., are all of the considerations by merchants and end-users.
How to plan and manage these requirements?
Usually, leaders of medium-scale enterprises choose to apply Enterprise resource planning (ERP). ERP is defined as the ability to deliver an integrated suite of business applications. ERP tools share a common process and data model, covering broad and deep operational end-to-end processes, such as those found in finance, Human resources, distribution, manufacturing, service and the supply chain. Planning is a success model accounting for about 60% of initial goal meeting. No plan, how and where does an organization go to?

The principle of "leadwise" - "managewell" has helped SEACRY.LOVE to rethink about planning. The result of plan-based performance is a big achievement. For a long-term strategy, it needs to be focusing on management whose core values are practiced and experience is captured by the enterprise.
