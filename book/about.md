Jean Wallet (JW) was 14 years old in 1990 counting back to his birth. He was born in a small countryside village in a northern province of Vietnam. 
He is now working with AYCH inc. As a founder, JW is leading a group of consultants and developers for business, enterprises and individuals. It has clients and users around the world.
His outermost concern is how to use AYCH inc technology in order to help enterprises and businesses achieve their goals at the minimum cost.

Ups and downs remain in any organizations and individuals. How do we improve our business performances?
Resources, efforts and goals are great things to come up with. Planning always takes time and resources to do so. Improvements or challenges? I do not know exactly the answer. I know one thing is to question you here that what can we do to minimize our costs in every process of our products and services?
I think we can do so when we are open and ready to learn from each other, share the knowledge and skills to each other in simplest way and with respect of privacy and intellectual property rights.

You are here because you put your priorities to reach the best cost service and products. We also do the same. In this short description, you will find about other 16 topics related to management and software development. All are written in plain text and serve as a live version of AYCH inc book. Normally, it should be produced and published as an eBook or hard copy version.
One question I seek your ideas is how to turn more users into our customers?

AYCH Inc., is  for "leadwise" and "managewell" principle.
