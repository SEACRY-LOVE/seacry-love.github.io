## Part 3: SEACRY.LOVE terms for market and business opportunities 

BaaS:
Backend as a Service
Backend cloud storage and processing for faster application development. Helps developers focus on their app‚Äôs features instead of spending time wondering how to scale.

also
Backup as a Service
Blockchain as a Service
Building as a Service

CaaS:
Containers as a Service
A complete runtime environment hosted in the cloud. Containers package up an app with all the bits it needs and standardize how it runs. Cloud containers make it even easier to test from anywhere, so no wonder the sector is exploding.
Market: Too soon to comment on size. Google and Amazon already involved, so clearly big opportunities exist.

CaaS:
Country as a Service
What if you‚Äôre Estonia‚Äîtechnically advanced with high living standards‚Äîbut no one wants to live there? Offer e-residency with access to a variety of digital services in the country. Where could this go in the future? Watch for developments in banking, tax, and business.

Compiler as a Service
Compliance as a Service
Content as a Service

Daas:

DaaS:
Device as a Service
(aka Hardware as a Service, Notebook as a Service)
Companies pay a monthly fee to lease the latest hardware, along with ongoing management and support.

Management as a Service
Messaging as a Service
(Bare) Metal as a Service
Mobile Backend as a Service

NaaS:
Network as a Service
Rented network functionality from a third-party that owns the infrastructure, usually an ISP. Scale up or down on port capacity as needed‚Äîworks best for companies with highly variable demand. An interesting model to explore when MSPs serve as the infrastructure provider renting to clients.

Market: Oversupply is driving the cost of kits down‚Äîthat‚Äôs bad.

Software as a Service
Centrally hosted software with subscription licences. The grandaddy of the entire -aaS market. Providers like it because regular monthly payments are better than one-time deals, and client like its flexibility.

Unified Communications as a Service
Managed and hosted communications channels.

VaaS:
Virtualization as a Service
One distant server, many accessible virtual machines. Ten years ago, turning one physical server into several virtual machines was a groundbreaking way to fully use server capacity and free up physical space. Today, it can be done via the cloud.
Market: Virtualization as a whole is considered a mature market‚Äînot many new opportunities here. Still, there‚Äôs $5.6 billion in revenue in virtualization as a whole.

Workspace as a Service
Virtual desktop environments. Just log in to access your office desktop, exactly as you like it, with all the business data and applications you need, from any device you choose.
