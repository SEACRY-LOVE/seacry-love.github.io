title: "Leadwise versus managewell"
---

SEACRY.LOVE leadwise is something of a mental balancing act. You are going to be cultivating two separate qualities of the mind--mindfulness and concentration. Ideally these two work together as a team. They pull in tandem, so to speak. Therefore it is important to cultivate them side-by-side and in a balanced manner. If one of the factors is strengthened at the expense of the other, the balance of the mind is lost and meditation impossible.

Concentration and mindfulness are distinctly different functions. They each have their role to play in meditation, and the relationship between them is definite and delicate. Concentration is often called one-pointedness of mind. It consists of forcing the mind to remain on one static point.

# Organization Knowledge

7.1.6 Organizational Knowledge
‘Organizational Knowledge’ is a new requirement and is closely linked with ‘documented information’. You should seek and record evidence that your organization has taken steps to identify the internal and external knowledge necessary to ensure the continued product conformity.

Check that organizational knowledge is communicated as necessary and that it is maintained and retained in accordance with Clause 7.5 – Documented Information. Check that organizational knowledge is reviewed before changes to the management system are made when responding to change.

You should seek to evidence to confirm how your organization has determined and made available the knowledge needed to keep up to date with changing situations and knowledge related to new products and services. You determine whether your organization has considered internal and external sources, such as:

Lesson learnt from non-conformities and corrective actions, near miss situations and successes;
Gathering knowledge from customers, suppliers and partners;
Capturing knowledge that exists within the organization, through mentoring or succession planning;
Benchmarking against competitors;
Sharing organizational knowledge with interested parties to ensure sustainability of the organization;
Updating the necessary organizational knowledge based on the results of improvement;
Knowledge from conferences, attending trade fairs, networking seminars, or other external events.
Sources of internal knowledge
There is a strong link between organizational knowledge and the competence of employees, the latter being peoples’ ability to apply knowledge to their work.

Organizational knowledge can be defined as information combined with experience, context, interpretation, and insights that are useful when making decisions and taking action specific to your management system. Examples of organizational knowledge include:

Documented information regarding a process, product or service;
Previous specifications and work instructions;
The experience of skilled people operating their processes;
Mentoring and coaching by more experienced employees;
Knowledge of technologies and infrastructure relevant to our organization, etc.
Sources of internal knowledge also include your business’s intellectual property; knowledge gained from experience and coaching; lessons learnt from failures and successes; capturing and sharing undocumented knowledge and experience; the results of improvements in processes, products and services.

Organizational knowledge should be maintained and available to the extent necessary. When addressing changing needs and trends, your organization should consider its current knowledge and determine how to acquire or access any necessary additional knowledge and required updates.

The knowledge necessary for the operation of processes and to achieve products and service conformity are evident through the following types of document:

Contract review requirements (Clause 8.2.3);
Demonstrate the operation of processes (maintain & retain documented information) (Clause 4.4.2);
Records of monitoring and measuring resources (Clause 7.1.5);
Competence records of personnel, training records, cross training, training feedback (Clause 7.2);
Operational planning and control process documents and records (Clause 8.1);
Supplier evaluation records (Clause 8.4.1);
Change control records (Clause 8.5.6);
Product non-conformity records (Clause 8.7);
Corrective action records (Clause 10.2);
Quality policy (Clause 5.2);
Quality Objectives (Clause 6.2.1);
Identification and traceability records (Clause 8.5.2);
Records of the release of products/services (Clause 8.6);
QMS performance and effectiveness (Clause 9.1.1);
Internal audit programmes and reports (Clause 9.2.2);
Management review minutes (Clause 9.3.3).
Sources of external knowledge
Sources of external knowledge often include other ISO/International standards; research papers; webinars from conferences; or knowledge gathered from, or about; our customers, stakeholders or other external parties. Your organization should assimilate and deploy internal and external sources of knowledge, such as:


## Lessons learnt
Lessons learnt from non-conformities, corrective actions, and the results of improvement;
Gathering knowledge from customers, suppliers and partners, benchmarking against competitors;
Capturing knowledge existing within the organization, e.g. through mentoring/succession planning;
Sharing knowledge with relevant interested parties to ensure sustainability of the organization;
Knowledge from conferences, attending trade fairs, networking seminars, or other external events.
A Certification Auditor would expect look for the following evidence for meeting the requirements of clause 7.1.6 organizational knowledge:
