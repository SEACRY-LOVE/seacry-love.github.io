First of all, you need to establish a formal practice schedule, a specific period when you will do SEACRY leadwise and nothing else. When you were a baby, you did not know how to walk. Somebody went to a lot of trouble to teach you that skill. They dragged you by the arms. They gave you lots of encouragement. Made you put one foot in front of the other until you could do it by yourself. Those periods of instruction constituted a formal practice in the art of walking.

In leadwise, we follow the same basic procedure. We set aside a certain time, specifically devoted to developing this mental skill called mindfulness. We devote these times exclusively to that activity, and we structure our environment so there will be a minimum of distraction. This is not the easiest skill in the world to learn. We have spent our entire life developing mental habits that are really quite contrary to the ideal of uninterrupted mindfulness. Extricating ourselves from those habits requires a bit of strategy. As we said earlier, our minds are like cups of muddy water. The object of meditation is to clarify this sludge so that we can see what is going on in there. The best way to do that is just let it sit. Give it enough time and it will settle down. You wind up with clear water. In meditation, we set aside a specific time for this clarifying process. When viewed from the outside, it looks utterly useless. We sit there apparently as productive as a stone gargoyle. Inside, however, quite a bit is happening. The mental soup settles down, and we are left with a clarity of mind that prepares us to cope with the upcoming events of our lives.

That does not mean that we have to do anything to force this settling. It is a natural process that happens by itself. The very act of sitting still being mindful causes this settling. In fact, any effort on our part to force this settling is counterproductive. That is repression, and it does not work. Try to force things out of the mind and you merely add energy to them You may succeed temporarily, but in the long run you will only have made them stronger. They will hide in the unconscious until you are not watching, then they will leap out and leave you helpless to fight them off.


# Management system guidance

## 9.0 Performance Evaluation
ISO Navigator Pro™ is a free tool that provides practical, expert guidance for businesses wishing to interpret and better implement the requirements of ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018.

Our range of templates cover the requirements of ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018, and offer an easy way to implement your next management system.
9.3	Management review
9.3.1	Management review - general
The guidance shown on this page is relevant to ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001. Top management must periodically review the management system to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness. The frequency or intervals of the Top management’s formal review must be defined. The management review must address the possible need for changes to policy, objectives, targets, and other elements of the management system.

Here's what management systems stanards are really all about: defining a policy and creating a plan with relevant objectives. You then implement the system according to the plan and begin auditing, monitoring and measuring performance against the plan and reacting to your findings. As such; management review meetings provide useful insight into the operation of the management system and its processes to enable Top management to respond to issues and to recommend improvements.

Who should attend management review meetings?
As per Clause 5.1 of the standards, it is important that a member of Top management chairs the management review meetings. It is imperative that everyone involved with the management review process fully understand and appreciate the management review requirements from Clause 9.3.

Other attendees at management review meetings should include functional management, line management, process owners, process champions, lead process users, and action owners within the scope of the quality management system, as appropriate, and the internal auditor(s) should also attend.

The management review process must ensure that the necessary information is collected ahead of time to allow management to effectively carry out an evaluation prior to the meeting. Note taking and action recording is often undertaken by the Management Representative who will forward minutes of the management review meeting to those on the distribution list and to those with actions.


## How often should we have management review meetings?
There are no specified time periods applicable to conducting management review meetings. However, they should be organized with a frequency and format commensurate to the level of risks and the complexity of your organization.

Critical management review agenda items, such as; process performance, customer feedback and monitoring and measuring results should be reviewed monthly, while less critical agenda items, such as reviewing the quality policy and objectives should be undertaken less frequently, perhaps every quarter.

This approach minimizes the length of each management review meeting, covers all of the required management review inputs over the duration of the management review programme, and allows for the analysis of trends in data while the information is contemporary. Our management system templates include this type of management review programme, you can download a copy for free.

Annual management reviews are insufficient in frequency to be able react to any issues effectively. Performance metrics should be monitored with varying frequencies, some hourly, some daily, some weekly and some monthly. Management cannot wait for six months to respond, if they do, it will be too late.

Top management might conduct weekly meetings in which they review metrics and objectives to determine if any corrective action is required. The process owner is then responsible for reporting close out progress in the meeting a week later. Every time management convenes to review and react to performance, it is considered as a management review.

Some companies have multiple review levels, whereby, each review may require multiple subjects and rely upon multiple metrics as inputs. Sometimes subjects are reviewed at more than one level, e.g. production numbers might be reviewed by the Production teams during daily production meetings and then by senior management, possibly weekly.

9.3.2	Management review - inputs
This now includes additional requirements for your organization to have a structured management review process that includes discussion of internal and external issue changes, and its potential effect on the strategic direction of your organization. The management review process should focus on the following inputs:

Observations, conclusions, and recommendations for further necessary action from the review must be recorded. If any corrective action must be taken, Top management should follow up to ensure that the action was effectively implemented.

9.3.3	Management review - outputs
Management review results should be summarized, specifying management commitments, directives and action items. Action items should specify responsible individuals and target completion dates. Affected individuals include those impacted by or responsible for addressing findings. You should seek and record evidence of outputs from the management review process, there should be evidence of decisions regarding:

## Process improvement actions;
Management system improvement actions;
Product and service improvement actions;
Resource provision actions;
Revised business plans and budgets;
Revised objectives and KPIs/SPIs;
Amendments to policies;
Management meeting minutes.
Any corrective outputs from the management review meeting should be actioned as necessary through the nonconformity and corrective action system. Auditors should expect to evidence the same outputs from management reviews as at present. However, they should note that the results of management reviews can now be held in any format that the organization chooses.

Management review meeting minutes, agenda, programme and presentations should be retained as documented information. Action items should be developed from the findings of the management review, while results and action items from the management review should be documented, communicated to affected individuals, and tracked to completion.
