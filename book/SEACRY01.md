title: "Customer satisfaction: Why does it bother?"
---

Customer satisfaction is not easy. It takes time and energy of the whole organization. It also takes grit, determination and discipline. A whole picture of organization can be manifested by adapting general guides and management principles. These are the key resources for vision, cores of values, objectives, action plans and proceses, culture and the management system.

# Backbone Management Principles

## Customer focus
Organizations can establish this focus by trying to understand and meet their customers’ current and future requirements and expectations.

## Leadership
Organizations succeed when leaders establish and maintain the internal environment in which employees can become fully involved in achieving the organization’s unified objectives.

## Involvement of people
Organizations succeed by retaining competent employees, encouraging continuous enhancement of their knowledge and skills, and empowering them, encouraging engagement and recognizing achievements.

## Process approach
Organizations enhance their performance when leaders manage and control their processes, as well as the inputs and outputs that tie these processes together.

## System approach to management
Organizations sustain success when processes are managed as one coherent quality management system.

## Continuous improvement
Organizations will maintain current levels of performance, respond to changing conditions, and identify, create and exploit new opportunities when they establish and sustain an ongoing focus on improvement.

## Factual approach to decision making
Organizations succeed when they have established an evidence-based decision making process that entails gathering input from multiple sources, identifying facts, objectively analyzing data, examining cause/effect, and considering potential consequences.

## Mutually beneficial supplier relationships
Organizations that carefully manage their relationships with suppliers and partners can nurture positive and productive involvement, support and feedback from those entities.

These principles form the conceptual foundation for the ISO portfolio of quality management standards and serve as the basis for the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) required by most government regulatory bodies. But these principles are not just the backbone of quality systems; they’re also simply good business principles to put into practice across an enterprise. The standardization of management approach based on them will be driving global improvement and process excellence for at least the next 10 years to come (since the latest version of 2015). 

Organizations can continue to audit their existing integrated management systems against the current revisions of ISO 9001 (2008 version) until September 2015. After that, with the ISO 9001:2015 standard in place guiding users toward better quality practices, organizations will find it easier to incorporate their quality management system into the core business processes and gain greater business benefit.


# Set suitable and successful strategy
It all starts with setting the right company strategy, including these elements:

Inspirational statement of purpose and direction. The old mission statements declaring your intent to be the “low-cost provider” is no longer a motivating vision for employees or customers. Engaging visions today include elements of social and environmental responsibilities, as well as economic returns to constituents.

## Market and customer positioning 
Clearly focusing on the right market and customer profile sets your competitor differentiation. It starts with understanding the drivers of customer excitement in advocating your solution, and ways to strengthen relationships. When customers are excited, your team becomes more engaged and productive.

## Customer and employee value propositions. 
What are the company’s solutions and practices that will be seen as win-win value by all constituents? Your managers and everyone on your team needs to understand how their actions and leadership relate to value provided. The strategy must drive leadership so that leaders can drive the strategy.

## Competitive and leadership leverage 
A good strategy provides opportunities for internal actions and leaders to optimize and extend a firm’s competitive advantage. This requires effective communication of intent, flexibility in implementation, and positive rewards for innovation and initiative in improving customer experience and quality.

## Constant restructuring for future advantage
A strategy that does not evolve as the market changes is a losing strategy. The internal team must see a reward in fostering change and leadership, and customers must be energized by new and improved processes, practices, and solutions. The best strategies are dynamic, rather than fixed.

A positive business strategy allows you to lead strategically by mastering the elements of both, separately and as an integrated whole. The authors argue that strategic leadership is an acquired capability that can and must be mastered by managers at all levels. It needs to extend to the firm’s directors, as well as investors. Everyone has to think and act strategically.


# Evolution to global business
Get it right the first time.
New companies are automatically global in reach and visibility, which makes a lack of strategy more impactful, since there is no move to an alternate environment for correction and restart. You need to get it right the first time, or there may not be a next time.

Bring it all together, successful leaders focus on customer satisfaction by knowing their customers, offering personalized services, providing training of products and services, easy-made-ready interactive with customers in order to listen to their needs, company branding and socializing, and offering extra benefits for the loyalty.


# Customer satisfaction as a requirement
9.1.2	Customer Satisfaction
This requirement is comparable to the requirements from ISO 9001:2008 Clause 8.2.1 – Customer Satisfaction, the change being that your organization must now solicit customer’s perception about your organization, and its products and services.

You should seek and record evidence that your organization has implemented a consistent and systematic approach to dealing with customer feedback and is obtaining information on customer perception.

Just collecting data on customer perceptions is not sufficient, you should seek and record evidence that your organization has analyzed and evaluated customer data and that conclusions have been made with regard to the effectiveness of the management system.

Are there any trends?
Is the situation stable, improving, or deteriorating?
Are customer needs and expectations changing?
Both internal and external auditors will look for proof that a consistent and systematic approach has been implemented to deal with customer complaints. This approach would typically include defined responsibilities for logging and tracking complaints, clearing technical issues, determining problem causes and actions to address them. Specific examples of complaints must be sampled.

The link between the customer complaint process and corrective action also requires special scrutiny. Determine appropriate methods for monitoring and measuring customer satisfaction by:

Using customer satisfaction surveys;
Providing methods for receiving and dealing with customer feedback;
Providing suitable processes to monitoring trends in, and reviewing customer data.
